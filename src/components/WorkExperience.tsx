      "This project is a comprehensive financial management system designed to streamline the complex financial operations of university student groups. It replaces inefficient spreadsheet and email-based workflows with a centralized platform for managing P-Card requests, Purchase Orders, and internal budgets. The application provides distinct interfaces for students, who can submit and track requests, and faculty supervisors, who have a powerful dashboard for oversight, approvals, and reconciliation with official university financial records. The result is a transparent, accountable, and efficient system that empowers students and simplifies administrative workload for faculty."

I wrote ROS nodes to handle GPS, ZED cameras, encoders, and IR sensors, and built a React + Tailwind UI with live camera feeds, six-joint sliders, and autonomy control via ROS Bridge. I also developed a pose-tracking system to control our 6-DOF arm with a point-and-click interface. Everything was tested and deployed for CIRC and URC competitions.",
